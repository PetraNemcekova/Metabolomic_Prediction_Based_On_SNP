# Metabolomic_Prediction_Based_On_SNP

Hordeum vulgare, as many other crops, suffers from reduction of geneticdiversity caused by climate changes. According to this, it is needed to improve performanceof its breeding. This paper deals with dynamic metabolomic prediction based on genomicdata [2] consisting of 33 005 single nucleotide polymorphisms of this crop and metabolomicdata [3] containing 128 metabolites were used. For this prediction, SVR, LASSO andsPLS were used. All three methods appeared to be appropriate for this type of prediction.Therefore, they can help for prediction of disease phenotypes or for expression of theimportant traits ofHordeum vulgare.

To run any of the predictions, the gen1_preprocessed and met1_preprocessed should be used. The second possibility is to use the raw genomic data from https://doi.ipk-gatersleben.de/DOI/0420f485-23ad-4dfa-9959-1a3e6807438b/436f7ff4-f37a-4c55-95e9-00f882326bf6/2 and metabolomic data from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274421/ and run the script preprocessing.py before running the prediction itself.
